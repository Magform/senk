# Senk Project

## Project Overview

The Senk project's primary goal is to harness the capabilities of an Arduino Nicla Sense ME board to create a robust system for collecting data from the integrated accelerometer and gyroscope. In addition to this core objective, we are rigorously testing a variety of features and configurations to optimize power consumption and ensure prolonged battery life for the device.
