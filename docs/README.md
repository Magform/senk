# Senk

> Accelerometer and Gyroscope Sensor

## Introduction

**Senk** is a project centered around leveraging the capabilities of a Nicla Sense ME to create a highly configurable device equipped with both an accelerometer and a gyroscope sensor.

### Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:

- **Sensor Integration:** Utilize the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors provided by Nicla Sense ME.
  
- **Configurability:** Design the device to be highly configurable using a simple configuration file, allowing for versatile applications.

- **Energy Efficiency:** Implement energy-efficient practices to optimize power consumption. With high customization, we aim to minimize unnecessary power usage.

- **Data Handling:** Enable the device to store sensor data in its internal memory and facilitate data transmission via Bluetooth Low Energy.
